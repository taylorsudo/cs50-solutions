Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

100 simulations would take longer than 10 simulations (false)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilised after about 10000 simulations
