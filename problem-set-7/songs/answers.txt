If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Analysing the audio aura involves factors like Energy, Danceability, Tempo, and Valence. High Energy could suggest positivity, high Valence may be uplifting, and high Danceability might evoke a similar feel. Conversely, low scores in these aspects could imply the opposite.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Our analysis is limited to the top 100, potentially missing the full spectrum of music. Music trends change, making it challenging to capture shifts. Moreover, personal interpretation plays a significant role—low Valence, Energy, and Danceability don't necessarily mean a song doesn't uplift the listener.
